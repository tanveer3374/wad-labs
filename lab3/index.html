   <p class="left-para">One of the IoT’s most distinctive aspects is the increasingly personal nature of the information collected. Connecting vehicles to the network means that others can track those vehicles’ movements and the manner in which they are operated. The use of smart devices in homes can reveal a great deal of information about residents’ habits and the ways that they live their lives. Attaching medical devices to the network can yield an immense amount of sensitive information about people’s health care. Combining multiple sources of data together and running predictive analytics on the resulting data can allow interested parties to infer surprisingly detailed levels of personal information about those using IoT devices. Interestingly, a survey of US consumers indicated that they are the most concerned about the sharing of information that reveals their personal habits (Rainie and Duggan 2016).1</p>
